# Ray (2023)
Simple engine to make and then navigate 3D maps Ã  la Wolfenstein3D, made entirely in C++, using SDL2 to handle graphics.

It's pretty rough, but very cute also <3

# Guide
After selecting a size for the map, the editor will open.
## Draw Walls
Use the **red spray** tool to place walls:

## Erase Walls
Use the **black spray** tool or the **mouse right button** to erase walls:

## A Place to Start
Use the **green spray** tool to set an initial position for the navigation.

This is mandatory, the rendering of the map will not start without it.

## Start Navigation
Finally, click on the **START** button and enjoy a nice walk through the map you've just drawn!

# Plans for future implementations
I'd like to add:
- A save/load syestem for the maps
- The possibility to place walls of different colors
- A loading system for external textures to use as walls or sprites
- A way to set movement patterns for the sprites
- Wait, is this becoming a game engine project?
- I really hope not, it would be exhausting and dreadfully time consuming...
